# Flip-2D
 
This project was developed during a Production Studio course. I was the only member of this project so all parts had to be programmed and implemented by myself. 

The main reason I chose to do this project was to learn OpenGL so that I could be more comfortable with it. I choose to do this with a fluid simulation was because I always found it interesting to see how games and media implement fluid that can be used during runtime. This gave me the opportunity to learn both OpenGL and fluid simulating at the same time.
